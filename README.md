# Pokedex Project for Git Workshop

Full-stack Django/React Pokedex app.

Use this as a team to practice the "feature branch" workflow. Each teammate [does *one* of the assignments](./your-assignments). If there are more assignments than teammates, everyone should do one, and once they are all merged to main, do the remaining.

The goal is to force communication and coordination/sequencing of 'what gets merged first.'

These assignments are more "finely sliced" than you would do in the real world to emphasize the need for communication, but provide a good general guideline of how wone can divide up work so teammates can get work done "in parallel."
